## Caroline Wen's Contributions (Pushed by Caroline Wen)

For this milestone, I focused on building the core technical components of our project.

I completed the full data integration workflow, including cleaning the unemployment dataset, aggregating monthly rates into annual values, selecting and processing the mental-health indicator, and merging both sources by state and year.

I generated the profiling outputs (missingness, coverage, summary tables) and produced the interim processed dataset. 

I also drafted the automation structure (run_all.sh, Snakemake skeleton), and organized the scripts for integration and quality checks. 

Overall, I initialize the technical implementation and ensured the workflow is reproducible for the next phase. (However, the data-acquisition automation is still pending and will be finalized in the next milestone. Also, the data integration logic may be further extended based on future analysis needs.)
